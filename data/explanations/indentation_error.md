Okay, I can help with that. Here's an explanation of the `IndentationError` based on the provided code and error message:

**What the error means:**

The `IndentationError` indicates that Python is not happy with the way the code is indented. Specifically, it's telling you that it *expected* a block of code to be indented (moved to the right) after the `if` statement.  Python uses indentation to define code blocks (like those inside `if` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and function definitions). It is the equivalent of using curly braces {} in other programming languages.

**Why it happened:**

Python's syntax relies on indentation to understand the structure of your code. The `if` statement creates a conditional block:  "If the condition is true, then execute the code inside the block." In this case, the code `print("Incorrectly indented")` should be *inside* the `if` block. Because it is not indented, Python cannot understand that it is part of the if-statement's block, and so it throws an error.

**How to fix it conceptually:**

To fix this, you need to tell Python which lines of code belong inside the `if` statement's block. You do this by indenting (usually with four spaces or one tab) the lines of code that should be executed when the condition (`True` in this case) is met.  Think of indentation as visually grouping the code that is part of a conditional or loop. Every statement inside a block should have the same indentation level to tell Python it's part of the same block.  If you had multiple lines to be executed, all of them would also need to be indented the same amount.
