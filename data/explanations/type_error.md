Okay, I can help with that! Let's break down the error.

**What the error means:**

The `TypeError: Operator "+" not supported for types "Literal['5']" and "Literal[10]"` message tells you that the `+` operator (which is the addition operator) cannot be directly used between a string and an integer in this way.  Specifically, it's flagging that you're trying to add something of type "string" (represented by `Literal['5']`) to something of type "integer" (`Literal[10]`). The term "Literal" suggests these are concrete, fixed values.

**Why it happened:**

In programming, the `+` operator behaves differently depending on the data types involved.

*   **With numbers (like integers or floats):** `+` means addition.
*   **With strings:** `+` usually means concatenation (joining strings together).

The error arises because the code attempts to use `+` with a string and an integer. The programming language doesn't know what you *intend* to do. Should it treat the string as a number and add it arithmetically? Or should it treat both as strings and try to concatenate them? Because the language can't implicitly guess what you meant (and doing so could lead to unexpected results), it throws a `TypeError`. This is because you cannot directly concatenate an integer to a string.

**How to fix it conceptually:**

You need to make sure the data types are compatible for the operation you want to perform. Here are the general approaches:

1.  **If you want to perform *addition* (arithmetically add the values):** You must convert the string `"5"` into a numerical representation (an integer or a float) *before* the addition. Then you can use the `+` operator for arithmetic addition. This would involve using a function that transforms a string into an integer type.

2.  **If you want to perform *concatenation* (combine them as text):**  You need to convert the integer `10` into a string representation first. Then, the `+` operator will concatenate the two strings. This would involve using a function that transforms an integer into a string type.

Choose the method that aligns with the desired outcome: either you want the sum of the two numbers, or you want the numbers displayed together as text.
