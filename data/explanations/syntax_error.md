Okay, I can help with that! Here's a breakdown of the `SyntaxError: unmatched ')'` for the provided code:

**What the error means:**

The error `SyntaxError: unmatched ')'` indicates that the Python interpreter encountered a closing parenthesis (`)` in your code without a corresponding opening parenthesis (`(`).  Essentially, the interpreter is expecting something to be enclosed *inside* a set of parentheses, but it finds a closing one without a matching opening one, so it doesn't know what to do.

**Why it happened:**

This type of error almost always stems from a simple typing mistake. In this case, the programmer has likely made a typo when trying to call the `print()` function.  The closing parenthesis `)` has no opening counterpart.

**How to fix it conceptually:**

The fix is straightforward:  Carefully examine the code and find the missing opening parenthesis, and add it in the correct place.  The goal is to ensure that every closing parenthesis is paired with a corresponding opening parenthesis.  Think of it like a matching game: every `)` needs a `(` before it to function correctly.
