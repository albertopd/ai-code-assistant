Okay, I'm ready to help! Here's a breakdown of the `SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?` you're seeing with the provided code snippet:

**What the error means:**

The `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` is a general error that Python throws when it encounters code that doesn't follow the rules (the syntax) of the Python language. The message "Perhaps you forgot a comma?" is Python's helpful hint suggesting a common mistake. In essence, Python is saying, "I don't understand this part of your code because it's written in a way that I can't interpret."

**Why it happened:**

The error specifically arises in the first line, the initialization of the `employees` dictionary: `employees = {"pam" 30, "jim": 28}`. Python dictionaries require key-value pairs to be separated by commas. In this case, the key "pam" is followed by the value 30, but there is no comma to separate it from the next key-value pair. Python is trying to interpret "pam" 30 as something else because it does not understand what to do with "pam" and then the number 30 without the comma.

**How to fix it conceptually:**

To correct the syntax, you need to ensure that each key-value pair within the dictionary is clearly defined and separated correctly. Specifically, you must add a comma to separate `"pam": 30` from the next key-value pair.
