Okay, I understand. I will explain the error without providing code solutions.

**What the error means:**

The `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'forty-two'` error indicates that the Python interpreter encountered a string that it couldn't convert into an integer. Specifically, the `int()` function was given a string ('forty-two' in this case) that doesn't represent a valid number in base 10 (our standard decimal number system).

**Why it happened:**

The `int()` function is designed to convert strings that represent whole numbers (integers) into actual integer data types that the computer can work with arithmetically. It expects the string to contain only digits (0-9), optionally preceded by a sign (+ or -). When the input string contains characters other than these (like letters), it's unable to perform the conversion.  In this case, 'forty-two' contains letters which is not a valid integer representation.

**How to fix it conceptually:**

To fix this, you need to ensure that the input you provide to the `int()` function is a valid numerical representation. This might involve:

1.  **Correcting the Input:** If the string should have been a number (e.g., someone made a typing error), you need to correct the string literal to be a valid integer representation (e.g., "42").

2.  **Validating the Input:**  Before attempting the conversion, check whether the string represents a number.  You might need to clean or sanitize the input string by removing non-numeric characters before converting.

3.  **Using Alternative Conversion:** If you have a string that represents a number spelled out in words (e.g., "forty-two"), you'll need a different approach. You could use a dictionary to map the words to their numerical counterparts. Alternatively, you might need to employ specialized libraries for natural language processing (NLP) that can handle such conversions.

4.  **Choosing appropriate data type:** If your string contains floating point numbers (e.g., "42.5"), you should consider using `float()` instead of `int()`.
