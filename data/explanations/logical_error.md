Okay, I'm ready to act as a teaching assistant. Let's break down the logical error.

**What the error means:**

A logical error, unlike a syntax error (typo) or a runtime error (like dividing by zero), means the code *runs* without crashing, but it doesn't produce the *correct* or *intended* result. The program completes, but the output doesn't match what the programmer expected based on the problem they were trying to solve. It's a "thinking" error, not a "coding" error in the strict sense.

**Why it happened:**

In this specific snippet, the logical error likely stems from the intention of the programmer. The code calculates `sum = a - b`.  The expected functionality, the goal of this code, probably involved a different operation.
*   **Example of a possible intention:** The programmer may have *intended* to find the *sum* of a and b, but accidentally used the subtraction operator (-) instead of the addition operator (+).
*   **Another possible intention:** Perhaps the program *intended* to calculate the difference between the two numbers, and the developer used the subtraction as expected.  However, if the intention was to always have the result be a positive number, the current operation might be the error.

The error lies in a miscalculation of the desired value. There are no actual errors in the code itself.

**How to fix it conceptually:**

To fix a logical error, you need to step back and review the programmer's intentions and the requirements of the task. Consider these points to conceptualize a fix:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Clearly define what the code *should* be doing.  What is the desired output or end result?  What is the purpose of calculating the `sum` variable?
2.  **Verify the Calculation:**  Examine the arithmetic operation performed. Is it the correct one to achieve the goal? If not, what mathematical operation *should* have been used to compute the *sum*?
3.  **Trace the Values:** Mentally "walk through" the code with some sample input values.  Follow the variables and see if the calculations lead to the desired result.
4.  **Revise the Operator:** If the goal was the sum (addition), the programmer should use the addition operator. If the goal was to calculate the difference of a and b, using the subtraction operator is okay, and it is possible the programmer intended it.
5.  **Consider Alternatives:** Ask if the program's requirement needs to be edited in a different manner. For example, should it always return a positive number? Perhaps the order the program subtracts the numbers should be changed.
