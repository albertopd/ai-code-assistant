Okay, let's break down the `ZeroDivisionError`.

**What the error means:**

The error `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero` clearly indicates that you're trying to perform a division operation where the divisor (the number you're dividing by) is zero.  Mathematically, dividing any number by zero is undefined, and in programming, it's considered an invalid operation that the computer cannot handle. The program cannot produce a valid answer.

**Why it happened:**

The error arises because your code attempts to divide the variable `x` (which holds the value 10) by the variable `y` (which holds the value 0). The Python interpreter, upon encountering this operation, recognizes that this is a mathematically undefined operation and a serious issue. This leads to the error.

**How to fix it conceptually:**

To fix the `ZeroDivisionError`, the core idea is to prevent the division by zero from ever occurring. This usually involves one or more of the following strategies:

1.  **Check the divisor before dividing:**
    Before performing the division, you must check if the divisor (`y` in this case) is equal to zero. You would use a conditional statement (like an `if` statement) to evaluate this.

2.  **Handle the zero case gracefully:**
    If the divisor *is* zero, you need to define how your program should respond.  You *cannot* perform the division, so you must do something else. The possibilities are:

    *   **Provide a default or substitute value:** Assign a reasonable default value to the result of the division (e.g., `result = 0` or `result = None`).
    *   **Display an informative message:** Print a message to the user explaining why the division cannot be performed.
    *   **Take alternative action:** Execute a different block of code that performs some other operation instead of the division.
    *   **Raise a different, more specific error:** In some cases, it may be appropriate to raise a different exception that fits your program's logic better. This allows for more specific error handling upstream.

3.  **Ensure the divisor cannot be zero from the start:**
     In some situations, you can design your program such that the value of the divisor is guaranteed never to be zero through proper input validation and data processing. This prevents the error from happening in the first place.
