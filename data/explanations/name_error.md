Okay, I'm ready to help! Let's break down this `NameError`.

**What the error means:**

The `NameError: name 'my_variable' is not defined` error means that the Python interpreter is trying to use a variable called `my_variable`, but it hasn't been "introduced" or "created" yet within the current scope of the code. Essentially, Python doesn't know what `my_variable` is; it doesn't have a value associated with it or a memory location allocated for it.

**Why it happened:**

This error occurs because you're trying to *use* a variable (`my_variable` in this case) *before* you've done one of the following:

*   **Assignment:** You haven't given the variable a value using the assignment operator (`=`).  For example, you haven't written something like `my_variable = 10` before the `print()` statement.
*   **Initialization:** You haven't defined or declared the variable.
*   **Scope Issues:** The variable might be defined within a different part of your code (like inside a function or a class), and you're trying to access it from a place where it's not visible.

**How to fix it conceptually:**

The fundamental fix involves ensuring that `my_variable` *exists* and has a defined value *before* you try to use it. Here's the core concept:

1.  **Declare or Initialize:** Before the `print()` statement, you need to "create" the variable `my_variable`. This usually means assigning it a value. This tells the interpreter that this variable exists and what value (or type of value) is associated with it.

    *   You can assign a specific value: `my_variable = 5` (assigning the integer 5)
    *   You can assign the result of an expression: `my_variable = 2 + 3` (assigning the result of the addition, 5)
    *   You can get value from input:  `my_variable = input("Enter a value: ")`

2.  **Scope Awareness:** If you believe `my_variable` *should* already exist, double-check where it was originally defined.  Is it inside a function?  If so, you might be trying to access it from outside that function's boundaries. In that case, you'll likely need to modify your code to make the variable accessible in the correct scope (e.g., by returning it from the function or using it as a function parameter).  If the scope is the issue, the variable can be declared/initialized in the calling context or using a global variable declaration (though using global variables should be avoided unless absolutely necessary).

In a nutshell, before you can `print(my_variable)`, Python needs to know what `my_variable` *is*. You tell it by assigning it a value or ensuring it's accessible in the appropriate scope.
